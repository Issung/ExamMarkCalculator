This is a very basic calculator with a sole function of calculating what mark you need to achieve on your school examination for each mark milestone. This calculator uses the milestones of my university, I am not sure if they differ at other universities. The marks are:
* High Distinction (80% or above)
* Distinction (70% or above)
* Credit (60% or above)
* Pass (50% or above)

These numbers are on the calculator incase you forget.

There are some basic features to tote:
* Supports having multiple units, you can also name and delete them.
* Saves your data on your local machine, so if you come back again in the future your data will still be there.
* Lightweight code, 3 files total (html, css and javascript), no server-side scripts, leading to a instant-loading experience to get your answers fast.
* Dark theme designed by an actual designer ([Tyler Hall](https://www.instagram.com/typedesigns_/)).
* Made by an actual student ([Me](https://github.com/Issung)).
